# Next.js 15 Client-Side Route Runtime Error: Uncaught ReferenceError

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in a Next.js 15 application that occurs on a client-side route. The error arises from accessing a variable before it has been assigned a value.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access the variable `undefinedValue` which is not defined.  This results in an `Uncaught ReferenceError` at runtime in the browser.  Standard development practices might not catch this before deployment.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file shows how to correct this by either assigning a default value to `undefinedValue` or implementing error handling (try-catch block) to prevent the application from crashing.
